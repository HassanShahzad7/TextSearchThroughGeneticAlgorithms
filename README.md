# TextSearchThroughGeneticAlgorithms
Built an application to generate a predefined or user entered text by Genetic Algorithm based on Darwinian Theory of Natural Selection. 
The process of Selection, Heredity (Crossover and Mutation) and Variation (random population of text) helped in searching the text by reducing the time taken by Brute Force (Infinite Monkey Theorem).
